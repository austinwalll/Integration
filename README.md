This program pulls new Diagnosis reports from one system and creates brand new work orders in our clients system.
Written in python utilizing the requests library, the program makes multiple calls to both APIs in order to
pass data securely and maintaining integrity between the two systems. 
This program was designed and written to automize the maintence systems ensuring our clients fast and reliable
maintenence orders, minimizing downtime and assisting their efforts to maximize efficiency within their factories.
